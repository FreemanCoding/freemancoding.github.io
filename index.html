<p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I created this GitHub as a fun project to help me learn more about CSS and HTML. I learn alot and also create a pretty fun games. I remain anynomous beucase of the nature of the game might be seen as inappropriate from administration and we dont want them to force me to take this down. I also am concealing my identity beucase this is the internet and you never know on the internet. Thank You for supporting me and to those of you who know who I am please keep it confidential. </p>

Feel free to just tell me stuff in the forms and not use them as intended, I will read it any ways. I will also include a TMA  or Tell Me Anything survey below.</p>
